# NAME

Hash::FieldHash - Lightweight field hash for inside-out objects

# VERSION

This document describes Hash::FieldHash version 0.13.

# SYNOPSIS

	use Hash::FieldHash qw(:all);

	fieldhash my %foo;

	fieldhashes \my(%bar, %baz);

	{
		my $o = Something->new();

		$foo{$o} = 42;

		print $foo{$o}; # => 42
	}
	# when $o is released, $foo{$o} is also deleted,
	# so %foo is empty in here.

	# in a class
	{
		package Foo;
		use Hash::FieldHash qw(:all);

		fieldhash my %bar, 'bar'; # make an accessor
	}

	my $obj = bless {}, 'Foo';
	$obj->bar(10); # does $bar{$obj} = 10

# DESCRIPTION

`Hash::FieldHash` provides the field hash mechanism which supports
the inside-out technique.

You may know `Hash::Util::FieldHash`. It's a very useful module,
but too complex to understand the functionality and only available in 5.10.
`H::U::F::Compat` is available for pre-5.10, but it is too slow to use.

This is a better alternative to `H::U::F` with following features:

- Simpler interface

    `Hash::FieldHash` provides a few functions:  `fieldhash()` and `fieldhashes()`.
    That's enough.

- Higher performance

    `Hash::FieldHash` is faster than `Hash::Util::FieldHash`, because
    its internals use simpler structures.

- Relic support

    Although `Hash::FieldHash` uses a new feature introduced in Perl 5.10,
    _the uvar magic for hashes_ described in ["GUTS" in Hash::Util::Fieldhash](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Hash::Util::Fieldhash#GUTS),
    it supports Perl 5.8 using the traditional tie-hash layer.

# INTERFACE

## Exportable functions

- `fieldhash(%hash, ?$name, ?$package)`

    Creates a field hash. The first argument must be a hash.

    Optional _$name_ and _$package_ indicate the name of the field, which will
    create rw-accessors, using the same name as _$name_.

    Returns nothing.

- `fieldhashes(@hash_refs)`

    Creates a number of field hashes. All the arguments must be hash references.

    Returns nothing.

- `from_hash($object, \%fields)`

    Fills the named fields associated with _$object_ with _%fields_.
    The keys of _%fields_ can be simple or fully qualified.

    Returns _$object_.

- `to_hash($object, ?-fully_qualify)`

    Serializes _$object_ into a hash reference.

    If the `-fully_qualify` option is supplied , field keys are fully qualified.

    For example:

    	package MyClass;
    	use FieldHash qw(:all);

    	fieldhash my %foo => 'foo';

    	sub new{
    		my $class = shift;
    		my $self  = bless {}, $class;
    		return from_hash($self, @_);
    	}

    	package MyDerivedClass;
    	use parent -norequire => 'MyClass';
    	use FieldHash qw(:all);

    	fieldhash my %bar => 'bar';

    	package main;

    	my $o = MyDerivedClass->new(foo => 10, bar => 20);
    	my $p = MyDerivedClass->new('MyClass::foo' => 10, 'MyDerivedClass::bar' => 20);

    	use Data::Dumper;
    	print Dumper($o->to_hash());
    	# $VAR1 = { foo => 10, bar => 20 }

    	print Dumper($o->to_hash(-fully_qualify));
    	# $VAR1 = { 'MyClass::foo' => 10, 'MyDerived::bar' => 20 }

# ROBUSTNESS

## Thread support

As `Hash::Util::FieldHash` does, `Hash::FieldHash` fully supports threading
using the `CLONE` method.

## Memory leaks

`Hash::FieldHash` itself does not leak memory, but it may leak memory when
you uses hash references as field hash keys because of an issue of perl 5.10.0.

# NOTES

## The type of field hash keys

`Hash::FieldHash` accepts only references and registered addresses as its
keys, whereas `Hash::Util::FieldHash` accepts any type of scalars.

According to ["The Generic Object" in Hash::Util::FieldHash](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Hash::Util::FieldHash#The Generic Object),
Non-reference keys in `H::U::F` are used for class fields. That is,
all the fields defined by `H::U::F` act as both object fields and class fields
by default. It seems confusing; if you do not want them to be class fields,
you must check the type of _$self_ explicitly. In addition,
these class fields are never inherited.
This behavior seems problematic, so `Hash::FieldHash`
restricts the type of keys.

## The ID of field hash keys

While `Hash::Util::FieldHash` uses `refaddr` as the IDs of field
hash keys, `Hash::FieldHash` allocates arbitrary integers as the
IDs.

## What accessors return

The accessors `fieldhash()` creates are __chainable__ accessors.
That is, it returns the _$object_ (i.e. `$self`) with a parameter,
where as it returns the _$value_ without it.

For example:

    my $o = YourClass->new();
    $o->foo(42);           # returns $o itself
    my $value = $o->foo(); # retuns 42

# DEPENDENCIES

Perl 5.8.5 or later, and a C compiler.
